# DCTA — Direct Conversational Transaction Agent

**Tencent Cloud AI CAN DO IT Hackathon Singapore 2026 — Banking Track (DBS)**
**Chosen scenario (stated up front): Scenario 1 — Voice-Enabled Payment and Transaction, with KYC and basic risk control.**

> **Blurb (under 10 words):** *Say it, see it, sign it — drafts, never debits.*

## The core principle (the whole pitch)

> **GenAI is a generator of drafts, never an executor of funds.**

The LLM turns language into a structured draft. It has **no credentials, no
execution path, and no authority** anywhere else. Every other step is
deterministic code, an independent check, or the human. Even if the LLM is
fully compromised, the worst outcome is a wrong draft the user sees and
declines. The security property does not depend on model behaviour and does
not degrade when the model does.

## Prerequisites

Three things, two of which `pip` cannot install for you. **All three team
members need all three**, or parts of the test suite will error rather than
skip.

| | Why | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Python 3.11+ | everything | already have it |
| **Node.js** | `tests/test_js_canonicalizer.py` runs `frontend/canonical.js` and proves it is byte-identical to Python's canonicalizer | `brew install node` |
| **Playwright Chromium** | `tests/test_e2e_webauthn.py` drives a virtual authenticator through the real WebAuthn ceremony | `playwright install chromium` (after `pip install`) |

Without Node, three cross-language canonicalization tests fail with
`FileNotFoundError: 'node'`. Without the Chromium download, the end-to-end
WebAuthn test fails with `Executable doesn't exist`. Neither is optional: they
cover the two properties the security model rests on — that what the browser
displays is what it hashes, and that a real biometric assertion is what
authorizes execution.

## Quick start

```bash
# one-time setup
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium          # browser binaries for the e2e test
brew install node                    # for the cross-language canonicalizer test

# seed the mock ledger (brief Section 13)
python -m backend.data.seed

# run the API
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
# open http://localhost:8000/  -> health + scenario
# open http://localhost:8000/api/seed/users   -> seeded users
# open http://localhost:8000/api/seed/headline -> 32-share arithmetic

# run the tests
pytest -q
```

> **Use `localhost`, never `127.0.0.1`.** WebAuthn binds credentials to the RP
> ID, which defaults to `localhost` (`WEBAUTHN_RP_ID`). Reaching the app at
> `127.0.0.1:8000` lets registration succeed and then makes signing fail with
> an unhelpful error.

## Credentials (for when we go live — NOT needed for M0)

M0 runs entirely on stubs; no Tencent credentials are required. To wire real
services later (M3 LLM, M7 ASR):

1. `cp .env.example .env`
2. Fill `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID` / `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY` from the Tencent
   Cloud console (CAM → API Key Management). **Never commit `.env`.**
3. The code reads these from the environment; stubs are used while
   `settings.has_credentials` is False.

## Architecture

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the pipeline and the
package responsibilities, and [`docs/TRUST_BOUNDARY.md`](docs/TRUST_BOUNDARY.md)
for the boundary table (what crosses each boundary, who could forge it, the
mitigation). Diagrams will be rendered before submission.

```
Voice/Text -> ASR -> sanitizer -> LLM parser -> resolver -> policy
  -> validator -> overlay -> WebAuthn -> gateway -> audit log
```

## Tech stack (brief Section 8)

- **Backend:** Python + FastAPI, SQLite, the Duo `webauthn` library, Pydantic v2 (frozen schemas).
- **Frontend:** plain HTML/JS (no React, no build toolchain).
- **LLM:** behind a swappable provider interface (Tencent Hunyuan preferred).
  Output handling: generate → validate against the Pydantic schema → reject
  and retry, bounded retries. The schema constraint is enforced **on our side**
  regardless of provider-side enforcement.
- **ASR/TTS:** Tencent Cloud ASR (Singapore region, English), Web Speech API
  fallback. Text input always works as a demo floor.
- **Auth:** WebAuthn for **transaction signing only**; app login is a mock session.

## Repo layout (brief Section 8)

```

    resolver/     # deterministic resolution + clarify loop

| 8 | Red-team demo + polish | |
| 9 | Submission package | |

## Demo script (brief Section 10)

1. **Happy path** — multi-intent voice command → one overlay → one fingerprint → both legs executed.
2. **Ambiguity** — "Send fifty to John" → disambiguation → correct payee.
3. **Anomaly** — "fifty thousand" to a usual-$50 payee → extra confirmation.
4. **Injection via data** — malicious biller reference → prove it never reached the prompt.
5. **Injection via voice** — spoken attack → at most a draft, flagged, declined.
6. **Rogue agent** — direct gateway call without a signature → rejected.
7. **Audit** — tamper with a log entry → `verify_chain()` pinpoints it.

## Honest limitations (stated in the pitch, not hidden)

- The OS biometric prompt signs a blind hash; "what you see is what you sign"
  is a *client-integrity* assumption, not a cryptographic guarantee. The
  out-of-band confirmation channel closes this gap for high-value transactions.
- The independent validation agent catches model error, drift and mis-parse —
  it does **not** defend against transcript-borne injection (handled
  architecturally: the user must still sign).
- WebAuthn platform authenticators are device-bound; registration is performed
  live in the demo, and the deployed HTTPS origin is tested a week before submission.
